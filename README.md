â€¢	A group project where we manipulated data extracted from Excel columns/rows. The analysis focused on pitchers and past CY Young award winners. The data was  modeled using linear discriminant analysis by applied the LDA() function from the MASS library. It was found that longevity and consistency in a pitcher increased the probability of winning the CY Young award.
